std::vector<bool> is a special case in the standard template library.  It's often implemented using bit manipulation for memory efficiency. However, this optimization can lead to unexpected behavior when using iterators.  Specifically, the iterators for std::vector<bool> are not random access iterators, even though it seems like a vector.  This can break algorithms that assume random access.
